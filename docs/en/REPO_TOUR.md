# Repo Tour (Dev)

This document is a quick map of the repository: what each folder contains and where to start reading/debugging the system.

## Main folders

- `api/`: Flask blueprint containing the REST API (JSON endpoints) and request validation.
- `bd/`: Data access layer (SQLite): connector, helpers, and persistence-related utilities.
- `data/`: Shared validators and business limits/rules (e.g., item/user validation).
- `debug/`: Logging and debugging utilities.
- `electron/`: Electron code (main process, preload) and the Python server launcher.
- `static/`: Static assets served by Flask (CSS/JS, etc.).
- `templates/`: HTML views (Jinja) served by Flask.
- `build/`: PyInstaller intermediate artifacts (temporary server build output).
- `dist/`: Build/distribution outputs (binaries and artifacts generated by PyInstaller/electron-builder).
- `logs/`: Local log files for diagnostics during development (utility folder; safe to clean).

## Key entrypoints

- `electron/main.js`: Electron main-process entrypoint. Creates the window and loads the server URL.
- `electron/python-server.js`: Starts/stops the Python server binary and resolves the port to use.
- `main.py`: Flask server entrypoint (UI + API blueprint registration).
- `api/API.py`: API blueprint `api_bp` endpoint definitions.
- `bd/bdInstance.py`: `db` instance initialization (resolves DB path and runs init).

## What NOT to touch (unless you know why)

- `build/`: Temporary PyInstaller output; it is regenerated.
- `dist/`: Build/distribution artifacts; it is regenerated.
- `node_modules/`: Node dependencies; regenerated via `npm install`.
- `venv/`: Local Python virtual environment; machine-specific.
- `**/__pycache__/`: Python bytecode cache; regenerated.

## Logs

- `logs/` is used to store runtime logs during development.
- Deleting files inside `logs/` is safe (you only lose diagnostic history).
